bachirulo brush
===============

a brush-and-ink calligraphy font for galu (![galu](img/galu.png)), a conlang
i'm currently designing

galu's sounds are composed of [morae][1], and written using a [syllabary][2]
with [diacritics][3], but for convenience sake this font uses ligatures to map
these glyphs directly to the languages' romanisation, like so:
